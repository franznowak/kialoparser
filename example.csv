Discussion Title: Did the Exodus Really Happen?

1. There is no historical evidence of Exodus happening.
1.1. Con: Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.
1.1.1. Con: Absence of evidence is enough to be skeptical about a certain proposition.
1.1.2. Pro: There are many events in the Bible asserted as false before being evidenced. Exodus being false would be a premature assertion.
1.1.2.1. Con: The [burden of proof](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burden_of_proof_\(philosophy\)) lies on those making the claim. If the claims of the Bible are to be regarded as true, then it must provide sufficient warrant in the form of evidence for its position. Given the extraordinary miraculous claims made in the story of the Exodus, an extraordinary amount of evidence must be provided beyond its text.
1.1.3. Con: Absence of evidence when evidence is to be expected to be found is a valid form of evidence in itself.
1.1.3.1. Pro: If the story of the Exodus was accurate, we would expect to find evidence for a migration of several million people wandering a small desert for several years. However we do not find any evidence of such a migration.
1.1.4. Con: Justified belief requires some sort of evidence. Therefore, belief without evidence is unjustified.
1.1.4.1. Con: There is geographical evidence that supports the existence of Exodus.
1.1.4.1.1. Pro: Geographical locations such as the [Red Sea](https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/glossary/crossing-of-the-red-sea#:~:text=When%20the%20Israelites%20reached%20the,14%3A%2019%2D31\).) and [Mount Sinai](https://www.britannica.com/place/Mount-Sinai-mountain-Egypt) are in the Exodus that still exist in today's era.
1.1.4.1.1.1. Con: This isn't evidence that the Exodus happened but rather only that whoever wrote Exodus was familiar with the area in which it takes place.
1.1.4.1.2. Con: Referencing of actual locales does not translate to accuracy of the work as a whole.
1.1.4.2. Con: The records in scripture and Jewish tradition constitute 'some sort of evidence'. The question should rather be how to weigh this evidence.
1.1.4.2.1. Con: We can explain the scripture without positing that any Exodus actually happened, so the scripture does not provide any significant evidence for an historical Exodus.
1.1.5. Pro: [Appeal to ignorance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_ignorance) is a logical fallacy, it should not be asserted that a proposition is true because it has not yet been proven false.
1.1.5.1. Con: This does not preclude the possibility that there is insufficient evidence to determine if a claim is true or false. Regardless of that fact though, the burden of proof remains that those making the claim must produce evidence to provide sufficient warrant for their position, or to abandon the claim as true citing there is insufficient evidence to consider it as true, which is not an admission that it is false, merely that it is unknown.
1.2. Con: There are [archeological finds](https://patternsofevidence.com/2019/06/01/artifacts-show-biblical-exodus/) that lend support.
1.2.1. Pro: There are Egyptian records that resemble parts of the Exodus story.
1.2.1.1. Pro: There are [Egyptian records](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/passover-in-egypt-did-the_b_846337) of the cities traveled by the Israelis.
1.2.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.4.1.2.
1.2.1.2. Pro: In a [papyrus](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/passover-in-egypt-did-the_b_846337) titled 'The Admonition of an Egyptian', an Egyptian named Ipuwer described the plagues with resemblance to those mentioned in the Bible.
1.2.1.2.1. Con: The [Ipuwer Papyrus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ipuwer_Papyrus#Ipuwer_and_the_Book_of_Exodus) explicitly details the immigration of Asiatics, not their emigration, which is directly contrary to the tale of the Exodus and is not accepted by historical scholars as an account of the Exodus.
1.2.1.3. Pro: A [papyrus](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/passover-in-egypt-did-the_b_846337) kept in the Brooklyn Museum holds the names of slaves; one named Shiphra. In the Hebrew Bible, a woman with the same name was one told to kill all Hebrew children at the time when Moses was born.
1.2.2. Pro: The walls of Jericho that the Bible claims fell down about 40 years after the Exodus \([Joshua 6:20-21](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Joshua%206&version=NIV)\) [were found](https://christiananswers.net/q-abr/abr-a011.html) and show remarkable similarities to the Biblical account.
1.2.2.1. Pro: The walls showed signs of [having been burned by fire](https://christiananswers.net/q-abr/abr-a011.html), just like it was in the Biblical account \([Joshua 6:24](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Joshua%206&version=NIV)\).
1.2.2.2. Pro: A portion of the wall [was spared](https://christiananswers.net/q-abr/abr-a011.html), just like Rahab's house was spared in the Bible \([Joshua 6:24-25](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Joshua%206&version=NIV)\).
1.2.2.3. Con: Archeological evidence indicates that the Walls of Jericho were destroyed during a well documented [Egyptian Campaign between 1700-1600BCE](https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/49BF732173E7890A2B0EC1B21CB6A817/S0033822200030666a.pdf/tell_essultan_jericho_radiocarbon_results_of_shortlived_cereal_and_multiyear_charcoal_samples_from_the_end_of_the_middle_bronze_age.pdf) and consensus amongst amongst scholars is that the [Book of Joshua holds little historical value.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Jericho#Origins_and_historicity)
1.2.3. Pro: Ancient Egyptians did [use bricks made in part using straw](https://www.jstor.org/stable/40000466), which matches [Exodus 5:7](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus%205&version=NIV).
1.2.3.1. Con: While true, making bricks with straw was [commonplace](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/287786412_With_without_straw_How_Israelite_slaves_made_bricks)(Egyptologist \nKenneth Kitchen has observed that these scenes \noer a visual commentary on the description of \nHebrew slaves in Exodus.7\nCollecting the straw for the bricks is especially \nhard work. The straw is usually taken from the ﬁelds \nafter the wheat has been harvested and crushed by \nthe farmers. In ancient times, the Egyptians left the \nstems of the wheat in the ﬁelds. This minimized the \nlabor needed for mudbrick production.) in ancient Egypt and much of the ancient world; thus, it is a detail that can exist in any work of fiction inspired by history and has little bearing on the narrative of the Exodus, yet alone proving it's accuracy.
1.2.4. Con: Modern scholarship finds that [that the biblical Exodus narrative has some historical basis, although there is little of historical worth in the biblical narrative or that the biblical exodus traditions are the invention of the exilic and post-exilic Jewish community, with little to no historical basis.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Exodus#Origins_and_historicity)
1.2.5. Con: Archaeologists Israel Finkelstein and Neil Asher Silberman say that archaeology has not found any evidence for even a small band of wandering Israelites living in the Sinai: ["The conclusion – that Exodus did not happen at the time and in the manner described in the Bible – seems irrefutable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Exodus#Reliability_of_the_biblical_account) \[...\] repeated excavations and surveys throughout the entire area have not provided even the slightest evidence."
1.3. Pro: The story doesn't make any logical sense.
1.3.1. Pro: Modern estimates based on information in the Book of Numbers indicates 2.5 to 3 million Israelites present during the Exodus. [A number which the Sinai Desert would be completely incapable of sustaining.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Exodus#Reliability_of_the_biblical_account)
1.3.1.1. Con: The Biblical narrative accounts for this by saying that God miraculously provided manna to sustain the Israelites in the desert \([Exodus 16:15-16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus%2016&version=NIV)\).
1.3.1.1.1. Con: In the time of 40 years, that no one outside the Jewish population would notice and document manna spontaneously appearing defies credulity.
1.3.1.1.1.1. Con: It's unclear who outside the Jewish population could have been present around where the manna was appearing and could have documented it if it happened.
1.3.1.1.2. Con: Miraculous or magical events within the story of the Exodus strain it's credibly, as we have no reason to believe they are possible.
1.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.1.
1.3.3. Pro: There are inconsistencies regarding the state of Egyptian livestock during the story. In [Exodus 9:1-7](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+9%3A1-7&version=NIV) a plague explicitly kills all of the Egyptian livestock. Then later in the story, [Exodus 9:8-33](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+9%3A8-33&version=NIV) & [Exodus 11](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus%2011&version=NIV) detail the health and death of said livestock who have already been killed.
1.3.4. Pro: The distance that supposedly took the Jews 40 years to travel is actually really short. In the Bible, they cross the Red Sea at the very beginning of the journey, meaning it should have only taken them a couple of weeks to get to Jerusalem, let alone the borders of today's Israel.
1.3.4.1. Pro: It is approx. [1,100km to lap the entire Sinai Peninsula](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/30.8893026,32.35984/27.8282197,34.1097284/29.4412095,34.8416552/31.2082481,34.1113014/30.8907365,32.3609387/\@31.0884142,32.9520898,7.49z/data=!4m22!4m21!1m10!3m4!1m2!1d32.9108233!2d29.2480713!3s0x145688ae5bd35d23:0xe4163797459721c1!3m4!1m2!1d33.5964736!2d28.3173128!3s0x14538fdb58bccf61:0xfd1b3bcd93fdfa7!1m0!1m5!3m4!1m2!1d34.5261311!2d30.5136922!3s0x1501e00ebbb11267:0xa3088e571e4b96a6!1m0!1m0!3e0). Even at a slow, charitable pace of 3km/Hr and only travelling 4 hours a day. It would take close to 90 days to lap the entire region. 40 years would allow someone to lap the entire Peninsula over 100 times within that span.
1.3.4.2. Con: The narrative of the Biblical text accounts for the longevity of their journey despite its short distance. In the narrative the Israelites stop at Sini for the revelation of the law, and then when they lack the faith to enter Canaan they are sent by God to wander the wilderness until that generation dies.
1.3.4.3. Con: [Exodus 13:17-18](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+13%3A17-18&version=ESV) accounts for a less direct route: 17 When Pharaoh let the people go, God did not lead them by way of the land of the Philistines, although that was near. For God said, “Lest the people change their minds when they see war and return to Egypt.” 18 But God led the people around by the way of the wilderness toward the Red Sea. And the people of Israel went up out of the land of Egypt equipped for battle.
1.3.5. Pro: -> See 1.3.1.1.2.
1.4. Con: The Bible can be considered a [historical document](https://www.kialo.com/should-the-bible-be-considered-a-historical-document-30051), therefore it can be considered historical evidence that the Exodus happened.
1.4.1. Con: The Bible can not be considered a historical document at all, because most of its stories are historically inaccurate according to the scientific understanding that we have.
1.4.1.1. Con: The Bible is by far the world's best and most accurate historical document. For centuries archaeology thought the[Hittites](http://www.christianorigins.com/2005/02/hittites-and-legendary-critics.html) existed only in the old testament and could not have represented a real civilization, yet they were found exactly where and when the Bible described.
1.4.1.2. Con: The Bible does not need scientific evidence since it does not coincide with science.
1.4.1.3. Pro: It is implausible that a mother would put her infant in a basket down the Nile, a river full of crocodiles.
1.4.1.3.1. Pro: Putting an infant in a basket down the Nile is essentially guaranteeing death.
1.4.1.3.2. Con: It is written in the Bible to what will transpire in the story.
1.4.1.3.3. Con: It is plausible that the river wasn't full of crocodiles at the time.
1.4.1.3.4. Con: Moses' mother had a choice. Either let her son die for sure due to the pharaoh's order, or send her child down the river for at least a chance that he may survive.
1.4.2. Pro: Many archeological finds have [determined](https://www.cslewisinstitute.org/webfm_send/410) the accuracy of historical events mentioned in the Bible.
1.4.2.1. Pro: The [Pontius Pilate stone](https://aleteia.org/2018/06/15/archaeological-evidence-of-pontius-pilate-corroborates-gospel/) records the name and position of [Pontius Pilate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pontius_Pilate), and corroborates his position as described in the Bible.
1.4.2.2. Pro: The existence of [Belshazzar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belshazzar), mentioned as the King of Babylon in Daniel 5, has been [confirmed](https://coldcasechristianity.com/writings/a-brief-sample-of-old-testament-archaeological-corroboration/) by tablets that have been discovered.
1.4.2.2.1. Con: The general consensus is that Daniel was [written](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Daniel) in the 2nd century BCE, about 400 years after the reign of [Belshazzar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belshazzar). It is therefore just as easy to regard Daniel as historical fiction based on a well-known king than as a thoroughly historical account.
1.4.2.2.1.1. Con: Daniel is [mentioned](https://saysf.org/book-daniel-really-trustworthy) in [Ezekiel 14:14, 20](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ezekiel%2014&version=NIV) and [28:3](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ezekiel%2028&version=NIV), which [claims to have been written around 600 BC](https://www.britannica.com/topic/The-Book-of-Ezekiel). Therefore, Daniel probably lived and wrote Daniel no later than 600 BC as well.
1.4.2.2.1.1.1. Con: Just because Ezekiel claims to have been written around 600 BCE doesn't mean that it was. [Pseudepigrapha](https://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780195393361/obo-9780195393361-0007.xml) \(works that misrepresent their origin and authorship\) are quite common in ancient texts.
1.4.2.3. Pro: There is archaeological evidence for events associated with the [United Monarchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Israel_\(united_monarchy\)) \(of Saul, David and Solomon\).
1.4.2.3.1. Pro: The [Mesha Stele](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesha_Stele), which dates to around 840 BCE, tells a story which supports many elements of the history presented in [2 Kings 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2_Kings_3#Verse_42).
1.4.2.3.1.1. Pro: The Mesha Stele may also contain an [inscription](https://www.bibleodyssey.org/en/places/related-articles/mesha-stela) mentioning a King David.
1.4.2.3.1.1.1. Con: The reference to David in the [Mesha Stele](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesha_Stele) depends on reconstructing parts of the stele that are incomplete. Scholars Israel Finkelstein, Nadav Na’aman, and Thomas Römer think the reference is to the Moabite king [Balak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balak).
1.4.2.3.1.1.1.1. Con: Michael Langlois was able to rule out the hypothesis that the Mesha Stele referred to King Balak [using](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesha_Stele) new imaging methods. Additionally, he concluded that the most likely reference remained to the house of David.
1.4.2.3.2. Pro: King Solomon's depiction in the Bible has been [partly confirmed](https://www.livescience.com/57494-fortification-found-israel-mining-camp.html) by the archaeological discovery of mining camps dating back to the 10th century B.C.
1.4.2.3.2.1. Con: There is no evidence that the mining camps were under the control of a United Kingdom of Israel. Many [archaeologists](https://www.newsweek.com/bible-david-solomon-timna-copper-mines-archaeology-717192) believe that it is just as likely that Egypt controlled the mining camps, or that they were not controlled by any central government at all.
1.4.2.3.2.2. Pro: Absent a large and powerful kingdom in the area, it is difficult to imagine why there would be a presence of such a large scale mining operation. This supports the idea of a Unified Kingdom.
1.4.2.3.3. Con: Even if a few specific figures or events have been identified, there is no [evidence](https://www.bu.edu/mzank/Jerusalem/cp/DavidSolomonmyth.html) outside of the Bible that they were associated with a United Monarchy that ruled both Israel and Judah.
1.4.2.3.3.1. Pro: Unless they demonstrate that there was a unified political project uniting the whole region of Israel, any similarities between the narrative of the Old Testament and the archaeological record are purely circumstantial.
1.4.2.3.3.2. Pro: In assessing the meaning of ambiguous archaeological data such as the Tel Dan site, archaeologists frequently rely on inference from the absence of evidence \([3](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-019-0307-9)\). But arguments from absence are very limited in what they can show, even in archaeology \([6-8](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-019-0307-9)\).
1.4.2.3.4. Pro: The [Tel Dan Inscription](https://www.bibleodyssey.org/en/people/related-articles/tel-dan-inscription), which is dated to the 9th century BC, is said to be the first reference to the House of David, referring to him as the King of Israel.
1.4.2.3.4.1. Con: The dating of the Tel Dan Inscription is controversial. Many scholars do not think it [dates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tel_Dan_stele#Dating) to the 9th century BCE.
1.4.2.3.4.2. Con: The Tel Dan inscription does not establish the nature of the kingdom that the House of David ruled. There is thus no reason to believe that it was the [Unified Kingdom](https://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Kingdom_of_Israel) described in the Old Testament.
1.4.2.3.4.3. Con: As of yet, only one reference to a king named [David](https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/06/world/from-israeli-site-news-of-house-of-david.html), or indeed to any biblical figures prior to King Ahab, has been found. This is insufficient on its own to count as corroborating evidence.
1.4.2.3.4.4. Con: According to the Biblical record, David would have been King from 1000-961 BCE, well before the writing of the inscription that bears his name. [Scholars](https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/06/world/from-israeli-site-news-of-house-of-david.html) acknowledge that this raises the possibility that the David referred to was a mythical king.
1.4.2.3.4.5. Pro: The Tel Dan inscription is of particular importance because it is an [Aramean](https://www.bibleodyssey.org/en/places/related-articles/judah-and-the-house-of-david) inscription, not an Israelite one. This demonstrates that other nations in the area were aware of the Kingdom of Israel.
1.4.2.4. Con: There is no archeological evidence, and indeed a substantial amount of evidence to which disproves the story of [Noah's Ark.](https://ncse.ngo/impossible-voyage-noahs-ark)
1.4.2.5. Con: -> See 1.2.2.3.
1.4.2.6. Con: There are [substantial issues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_the_Bible#The_Bible_and_science) concerning the genesis creation narrative, across multiple scientific disciplines, and thus is considered a myth by archeologists.
1.4.3. Con: The Bible was written when Israel was captive in Babylon, long after Egypt; too long to be considered "historical". It would have been reiteration of oral tales. Again, not considered "historical" in regards to Exodus.
1.4.3.1. Con: That being said, it doesn't mean the oral tales were outright wrong; just prone to drift from being purely accurate.  So, Exodus cannot be taken word-for-word historical.  Just a good starting point when researching history.
1.4.4. Con: Historical evidence rarely changes. However, there are many versions of the Bible that may indicate its recordings are more myth tailored to the demographics of its readers.
1.4.4.1. Con: The existence of different translations of the Bible does not indicate it is a "myth." Many older texts have several different translations.
1.4.4.2. Pro: There are many parallels between the stories found in the Bible and [mythology.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_mythology) It is likely Exodus is one of them.
1.4.4.2.1. Con: Perhaps it is mythology that got its parallels from Exodus.
1.4.5. Con: Even most people who strongly believe in the truth of the Bible would concede that much of it is metaphorical. A book of metaphors can only be considered historical evidence in a very narrow sense, namely regarding the history of metaphors.
1.4.5.1. Con: It does not follow from 'much of the Bible is metaphorical' that all of the Bible or the passage in question is. Each Biblical text should be evaluated on its own merits.
1.5. Pro: There aren't any Egyptian documents that tell any of the events described in the book of Exodus.
1.5.1. Con: Recording that a large number of people left would be embarrassing for the Pharaoh and therefore could be deleted.
1.5.1.1. Pro: A large amount of people exiting under the Pharoah's reign make him appear weak, not in control of those under his ruling.
1.5.1.1.1. Pro: Allowing this information to live on, may have put the Pharaoh and his throne in jeopardy of defeat. Not recording this information is thus a possibility.
1.5.2. Con: -> See 1.2.1.
1.5.3. Pro: It seems unusual for the time that there is no Egyptian record keeping; not even of the plagues.
1.5.3.1. Con: Many Egyptian documents, such as in the [Library of Alexandria](https://ehistory.osu.edu/articles/burning-library-alexandria), were destroyed over time.
1.5.3.1.1. Pro: There are [no surviving Egyptian records](https://www.aish.com/jw/s/Evidence-for-the-Exodus.html)(More generally, there is a limit to what we can expect from the written record of ancient Egypt. Ninety-nine percent of the papyri produced there during the period in question have been lost, and none whatsoever has survived from the eastern Nile delta, the region where the Torah claims the Children of Israel resided.) from the region where the Bible claims the Exodus happened.
1.5.3.2. Con: -> See 1.2.1.2.
1.5.4. Con: We have don't have a full record of Egypt's history. The vast majority of records from that long ago are probably lost. Nevertheless there are many clues that collaborate the Bibles account [viewzone.com](http://viewzone.com/exodus.html)
1.5.5. Con: The Egyptians only documented their own historical accomplishments. Exodus would not be documented since it is not considered such.
